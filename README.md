This novel project consists of code that uses the find and replace method in google colab to alter the text of Frankenstein. This text was downloaded from project Gutenburg and is linked in this project. The code itself renames Frankenstein in the Frankenstein novel to Mr. Fluffy and, the word monster to fairy. Since this is a very dark novel I thought these simple changes would overall change the connotations of the novel and add a bit of humor. However, it could just as easily be changed to print different words as well. For this novel assignment I chose this because I felt these best created something that changed the story itself. However, in the future I would like to go further and create something that potentially changes the plot.
